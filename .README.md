# What is this?
Once upon a time, I kept messing up stupid things like `== null` or `is null` checks.
To make fun of myself (and get better), I created a little console app to help not
make dumb mistakes like that.

# How to use it:
1. run `./publish.sh` in the root directory to publish the app to
`/c/dev/builds/dotnet-trainer`
2. Either add `/c/dev/builds/dotnet-trainer` to the `PATH` variable or navigate
to `/c/dev/builds/dotnet-trainer`
3. Run `dotnet-trainer --help` to see all of the tests
  - You can ignore `hello-world` because I was learning this NuGet package
